# Spooky-Turkey-Video-Game-Jam

My contribution to the Uvic GameDev Spooky Turkey Video Game Jam.

Version 1.1


Kyle Hoffmann - November 11/15

Two mini-games built for the Spooky Turkey Video Game Jam. They were both to be part of a larger game, where two players compete to collect lost souls. Due to the deadline only one of the two minigames were implemented. 

One player uses the keyboard and controls the ghost on the screen using the arrow keys and space. The
Second player uses a game pad. 

The first player has a quadruple jump bound to space and the up arrow. Down ends the jump and makes you drop faster. The left and right keys make you move right and left on the screen. Touching a leaf stuns you. Collecting a ghost gives you a point.

In the first stage touching the wall kills you. The sceond stage is endless.

If the second player is using an x-box controller 'B' speeds up the stage. 'X' permanently speeds up the rate of leaves falling, and tempoarily multiplies the number of leaves falling. 'Y' Causes a Jump scare. In the second game it also hides all of the platforms.

In the first stage the second player can also increase the stage's sway by holding the 'A' key.
